# Release Notes Index

Structured, immutable snapshots of each tagged release.  
For ongoing aggregated history, see the root CHANGELOG.md.  
For community-facing summary UI, see GitHub Releases.

## Index

- [v0.1.1](./v0.1.1.md) â€“ 2025-08-30 (Docs-only; provenance clarification for dual-hash section)

## Conventions

- One file per tag: `RELEASE_NOTES/<version>.md`
- Files are immutable after tag publication (only fix typos with a follow-up commit; never rewrite semantics).
- Commit message pattern: `docs(release-notes): add <version> snapshot`
- Optional YAML front matter may appear at the top of each file for tooling.
