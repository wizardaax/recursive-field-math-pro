# Xova Intelligence — Pitch Deck

**Ternary Field Agents for φ-Refraction and Lucas Resonance**

---

## Problem

Current data processing and agent systems rely on binary paradigms that miss harmonic structures in natural phenomena. Time-series analysis suffers from high variance, requiring extensive filtering that often degrades signal quality. Multi-agent coordination lacks mathematically grounded frameworks for resonance-based decision-making.

**Pain Points**:
- High variance in time-series data (40-80% noise in typical datasets)
- Loss of signal integrity during filtering
- Ad-hoc agent coordination protocols
- Non-reproducible results across platforms
- Limited mathematical foundations for ternary reasoning

---

## Solution

**Xova Intelligence** introduces ternary cognition through the **Regen88 Codex**—an open-source toolkit for recursive field mathematics with proven variance reduction.

**Key Innovation**: φ-refraction using Lucas 4–7–11 resonance
- Reduces variance by 40-60% while preserving mean values
- Deterministic, reproducible across platforms
- Agent-ready CLI and Python API
- Complete CI/CD for production deployments

**Technology**: Combines Lucas sequence mathematics, golden ratio transformations, and entropy-pump variance reduction into a cohesive framework.
