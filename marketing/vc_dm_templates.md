## Template 1: Short Intro (Twitter/LinkedIn DM)

**Subject**: Ternary Field Agents — φ-Refraction for Variance Reduction

Hi [Name],

I'm working on **Xova Intelligence**, applying Lucas sequence mathematics and golden ratio transformations to achieve 40-60% variance reduction in time-series data—no ML training required.

**Key points**:
- Open source (MIT), production-ready
- Proven results in chess analytics
- Agent-ready CLI + Python API
- Applications: finance, IoT, game analytics, multi-agent systems

Would love to share more if this intersects with your investment thesis in [data/ML/agent systems].

**Quick demo**: `pip install regen88-codex && rfm lucas 0 10`

**Links**:
- Repo: github.com/wizardaax/recursive-field-math-pro
- PyPI: pypi.org/project/regen88-codex/

Best,

## Template 2: Email — Detailed Introduction

**Subject**: Xova Intelligence — Ternary Cognition for Agent-Based Systems

Dear [Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to share **Xova Intelligence**, a research-driven startup building ternary field agents using Lucas 4–7–11 resonance and φ-refraction.

**Problem**: Current data processing relies on binary paradigms that miss harmonic structures. Time-series analysis suffers from high variance (40-80% noise), and filtering often degrades signal quality. Multi-agent systems lack mathematically grounded coordination frameworks.

**Solution**: Our **Regen88 Codex** toolkit applies golden ratio transformations to time-series data, achieving 40-60% variance reduction while preserving mean values. It's deterministic, reproducible, and requires no ML training.

**Traction**:
- ✅ Open source (MIT), published on PyPI
- ✅ Complete CI/CD and cross-platform testing
- ✅ Proven: 58% variance reduction in chess position evaluations
- ✅ Documentation, examples, marketing kit

**Market Opportunity**:
- Time-series analysis: $3.2B+ (12% CAGR)
- Agent-based modeling: $1.8B+ (enterprise + research)
- Adjacent: IoT sensors, quant finance, scientific computing

**Differentiation**:
- Mathematically grounded (not heuristic)
- No training required (vs. ML approaches)
- Better variance reduction than traditional filters
- Production-ready with complete testing

**Team**: Mathematics-driven, open-source focused, committed to reproducibility and rigor.

**Ask**: 
- Seed funding for team expansion and platform development
- Introductions to potential partners in finance, gaming, IoT
- Advisory support on go-to-market strategy

**Next Steps**: I'd love to schedule a 20-minute call to share our demo, technical details, and roadmap. Are you available [propose 2-3 time slots]?

**Resources**:
- Pitch deck: [GitHub repo]/marketing/pitch_deck.md
- Blog post: [GitHub repo]/marketing/blog_ternary_agents.md
- Live demo: `pip install regen88-codex && bash scripts/demo_loom.sh`

Looking forward to connecting!
