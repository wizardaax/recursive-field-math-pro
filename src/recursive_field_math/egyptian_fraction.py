"""
Egyptian fraction decomposition for the Lucas 4-7-11 signature.

Egyptian fractions are sums of distinct unit fractions (fractions with
numerator 1). The ancient Egyptians used such representations for all
rational numbers.

The Lucas 4-7-11 Signature:
The triplet (L₃, L₄, L₅) = (4, 7, 11) has the remarkable property:
    1/4 + 1/7 + 1/11 = 149/308

Finding the common denominator:
    LCD(4, 7, 11) = 4 × 7 × 11 = 308

Computing the sum:
    1/4 = 77/308
    1/7 = 44/308
    1/11 = 28/308
    Sum = (77 + 44 + 28)/308 = 149/308

Properties of 149/308:
- Decimal: ≈ 0.4837662...
- This is close to 1/2 but has interesting number-theoretic properties
- 149 is prime, making 149/308 irreducible
- The difference from 1/2 is 5/308 ≈ 0.0162...

Applications in the Matrix:
1. **Entropy Generation**: The near-irrational nature (prime numerator) makes
   this fraction useful for pseudorandom number generation
2. **Field Spacing**: The 149/308 ratio can be used for non-resonant spacing
3. **Cryptographic Timing**: Interval calculations avoiding simple periodicity
4. **Symbolic Indexing**: Natural partitioning based on Lucas triplet properties

Historical Note:
Egyptian fractions were used in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE).
The representation of 2/n as sums of unit fractions was particularly important.

def egypt_4_7_11():
    """
    Compute the exact Egyptian fraction sum 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/11.

    Returns the result as an irreducible fraction (numerator, denominator).

    Mathematical derivation:
        1/4 + 1/7 + 1/11
        = (77 + 44 + 28) / 308  [common denominator: 4×7×11 = 308]
        = 149/308               [149 is prime, so this is irreducible]

    Returns:
        Tuple of (numerator, denominator) = (149, 308)

    Examples:
        >>> num, den = egypt_4_7_11()
        >>> num
        149
        >>> den
        308
        >>> num / den
        0.4837662337662338
        >>> # Verify the calculation
        >>> from fractions import Fraction
        >>> Fraction(1, 4) + Fraction(1, 7) + Fraction(1, 11) == Fraction(149, 308)
        True

    Mathematical Note:
        This fraction is related to the Frobenius number F(4,7) = 17.
        The Frobenius number is the largest integer that CANNOT be represented
        as a non-negative integer linear combination of 4 and 7.

        The Egyptian fraction 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/11 has connections to:
        - Continued fraction approximations to irrationals
        - Greedy algorithm for Egyptian fraction expansion
        - Sylvester's sequence and unit fraction expansions
